Turn snippets of text into tweet-able links with a shortcode.

== Description ==

Snap Tweet allows you to easily embed tweet-able links (which will be identified with the Twitter logo) within an article, using the [snaptweet][/snaptweet] shortcode. Users are often more likely to tweet a specific quote from an article, rather than just a generic "Tweet this article" link.

== Installation ==

1. Download and un-zip the `snap-tweet.zip` file
2. Upload the contents of the un-zipped folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory 
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Place [snaptweet][/snaptweet] tags around any text you want to make tweet-able.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need a Twitter app/account to use this plugin? =

No, it uses GET data to create the link, meaning that you don't need even need a Twitter account. Users will need a Twitter account to use the links, of course.

= Can I apply my own CSS? =

YES! I want to add a built-in CSS editor in time, but for now, links are wrapped in a <span> tag, which gives them the .snaptweet CSS class - just add some CSS to your theme's style.css and you're good to go.
